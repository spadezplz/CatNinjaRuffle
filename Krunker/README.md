## What is it actually tho?
so to put it pretty simply, imagine krunker, just unblocked so i can play it on a school chromebook or computer or something without using a vpn or being blocked by that thingy called securely

## Will there be anything else like this?
yea probably for old school runescape

# Why have a readme?
